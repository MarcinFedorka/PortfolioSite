    <p>
        Hi, I'm Marcin! I'm a software engineer with over four years of
        professional experience in back-end and embedded software development.
        I'm specialising in building solutions that bridge hardware and software for
        manufacturing environments.
        My work has spanned designing full-stack applications, creating automated testing systems,
        and managing relational databases to support complex manufacturing workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently at Everfox (formerly Garrison), I lead cross-functional engineering projects,
        delivering hardware electronics test solutions, integrating with Linux systems,
        and overseeing both hardware and software commissioning.
        My role involves developing Python and C++ applications for automation,
        building front-end and back-end database solutions,
        and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to ensure robust, reliable deployments.
        I also look after a small IT infrastructure used for development, deployment and production.
    </p>
    <p>
        My academic background is a First-Class MEng Electronic Engineering degree, where I worked on
        projects from embedded MQTT systems to AES encryption firmware.
        I'm skilled in Python, C++, GitLab, SQL, VMware and a broad range of other electronics and IT tools.
        Whether it's developing embedded software, optimising manufacturing processes,
        or setting up network infrastructure, I enjoy creating systems that work seamlessly
        from concept to production.
    </p>
